                        including individuals who are driving, working, or tuned in at home. By using the correct 
                        messaging and targeting, they are able to reach out to potential customers who are highly 
                        likely to have an interest in their product or service </li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-effective</strong> – Advertisers can achieve a successful radio campaign without 
                        overspending by taking advantage of lower production costs and airtime rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engaging</strong> – Radio commercials enable businesses to produce captivating material that can 
                        grasp their audience’s interest with the use of sound effects, music, and voice talent. This 
                        can make their brand noticeable and leave a lasting impact on potential customers. </li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting</strong> – Broadcasting stations serve particular audiences, enabling advertisers to aim

                        chance of making a purchase. </li>
